# RCNN Model for Object Detection

This repository contains code and model files for training and evaluating an RCNN-based object detection pipeline. It includes support for Mask R-CNN using Keras and TensorFlow.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Detect and segment objects in images using a pretrained or custom-trained Mask R-CNN model.
- Load and visualize training data, annotations, and prediction outputs.
- Fine-tune or apply Mask R-CNN on your own dataset.
